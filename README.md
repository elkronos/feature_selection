# Feature Selection Repository

This repository contains a collection of R functions to assist with feature selection and dimensionality reduction. Each script is thoroughly documented with its purpose, key assumptions, usage examples, and expected outputs to help you select the most appropriate method for your data analysis and predictive modeling tasks.

The functions can be organized into four main categories:

- **1. Statistical & Filter Methods**
- **2. Regularization Methods**
- **3. Model-Based & Wrapper Methods**
- **4. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**
